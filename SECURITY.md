## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Please do NOT open public GitHub issues for security vulnerabilities.**

If you discover a security vulnerability in Knowtique, please report it responsibly:

1. **Email**: Send details to the repository maintainer via GitHub private message
2. **Include**:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested fix (if any)

## Response Timeline

- **Acknowledgement**: Within 48 hours
- **Initial Assessment**: Within 5 business days
- **Fix & Disclosure**: We aim to release a fix within 30 days of confirmation

## Scope

The following are in scope:
- Backend API vulnerabilities (authentication bypass, injection, etc.)
- Frontend XSS or CSRF vulnerabilities
- Secret/credential exposure in source code
- Dependency vulnerabilities with known exploits
- LLM prompt injection that bypasses guardrails

The following are out of scope:
- Vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies without a working exploit
- Social engineering attacks
- Denial of service attacks

## Security Best Practices for Deployment

1. **Always set `SECRET_KEY`** in your `.env` file — never use the default
2. **Use environment variables** for all API keys — never commit them to source control
3. **Enable HTTPS** in production via a reverse proxy (nginx, Caddy, etc.)
4. **Restrict CORS origins** to your actual frontend domain
5. **Use PostgreSQL** in production — SQLite is for development only
6. **Review the auth module** (`core/auth.py`) and implement proper authentication before exposing to the internet
